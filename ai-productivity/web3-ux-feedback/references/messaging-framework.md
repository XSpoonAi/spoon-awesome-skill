# Messaging Framework Reference

The 5-Part SaaS Messaging Framework adapted for web3 projects.
Used by the `web3-ux-feedback` skill during messaging analysis.

## The Core Distinction: Messaging vs. Copy

**Messaging** = WHAT you say (the strategic points, the narrative, the positioning)
**Copy** = HOW you say it (the exact words, tone, channel-specific phrasing)

Evaluate messaging first. A beautifully written headline about the wrong thing
is still wrong. Messaging stays consistent across the product. Copy adapts.

## Part 1: Market Context

**Question:** What's changing in the world that makes this project necessary NOW?

Strong market context answers:
- What trend or shift is happening in web3/crypto?
- What problem does that create for users?
- Why does it matter to the target user specifically?

**Weak example:**
> "The future of finance is decentralized."
*(Generic, no urgency, no problem, no user context)*

**Strong example:**
> "Cross-chain activity grew 400% last year — but bridge fees still eat 8–15%
> of every trade. Traders are losing hundreds of dollars a month to move their
> own assets."

**Why this matters in web3:** Crypto moves fast. Context-setting tells visitors
WHY NOW is the moment to pay attention and signals that the team understands
the market — a credibility signal in itself.

## Part 2: Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

**Question:** Who is specifically facing this problem the most?

### ICP Dimensions for Web3

| Dimension | Options |
|-----------|---------|
| Technical sophistication | Developer / Power user / Casual / Newcomer |
| Experience | Crypto native / Web3 curious / Crypto skeptic |
| Role | Trader / Collector / DAO member / Creator / Builder / Fund |
| Scale | Retail / High-net-worth / Institutional / Protocol |
| Motivation | Yield / Community / Ownership / Speculation / Access |

### Specificity Test

```
❌ Too broad: "For crypto users"
❌ Still too broad: "For DeFi users"
✅ Specific: "For DeFi traders making 10+ cross-chain swaps per week"
✅ Specific: "For DAO operators managing $1M+ in community treasury"
```

**Note:** Multiple ICPs need separate messaging. A message for DeFi power
traders will actively repel NFT newcomers. Don't try to serve both in the
same hero section.

## Part 3: Competitive Alternatives

**Question:** What would users do if this project didn't exist?

Think in clusters — not just direct competitors:

| Cluster | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Direct competitors | Same problem, similar approach | Another cross-chain DEX |
| Indirect alternatives | Different approach, same problem | Using a CEX instead |
| Status quo | What they do today without any tool | Manual bridging in 4 steps |
| Do nothing | Cost of inaction | Keep losing to bridge fees |

**Don't bash competitors.** Instead: acknowledge the alternative, name the
specific limitation it has for your ICP, position your product as the gap-filler.

**Example:**
> "Stargate is great for simple ETH↔Base transfers. But for traders moving
> across 6+ chains daily, manual routing costs 3–4x more than it needs to."

---

## Part 4: Product (Capabilities Over Features)

**Question:** What can users DO now that they couldn't before?

### The Ladder

Always climb from feature to capability to benefit:

```
Feature (weakest):
"We have a multi-sig wallet integration"

Capability (better):
"Require 2-of-3 approvals for any treasury transaction"

Benefit (best):
"Your DAO funds stay safe even if one member's wallet is compromised"
```

### Web3 Feature Translation Examples

| Technical Feature | User Capability | User Benefit |
|------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Gasless transactions | Trade without paying gas | Keep 100% of trade value |
| ZK proofs | Private on-chain activity | Your strategy stays hidden |
| Cross-chain bridge | Move assets between chains | Never locked into one ecosystem |
| On-chain governance | Vote on protocol decisions | Real say in how it works |
| Lazy minting | Create NFTs without upfront gas | Launch collection with zero upfront cost |
| Auto-compounding | Reinvest rewards automatically | Earn more without daily management |

**Rule:** Pick the top 3 capabilities for the landing page. A feature dump
signals insecurity. Focused capabilities signal a sharp, confident product.

---

## Part 5: Value Proposition

**Question:** What's the measurable outcome + why should users trust you?

### 5a. Functional Benefits (practical, quantifiable)
- Time saved: "Set up DAO governance in 10 minutes, not 10 weeks"
- Money saved: "Reduce bridge fees by 70%"
- Risk reduced: "$0 lost to exploits in 18 months of operation"
- Complexity eliminated: "No coding required — ever"

### 5b. Emotional/Social Benefits
- Safety: "Your funds, your keys, your control"
- Status: "Used by the top 20 DeFi protocols on Ethereum"
- Belonging: "Join 12,000 traders who already made the switch"
- Empowerment: "Finally, governance that actually works"

### 5c. Social Proof (Web3 Hierarchy)

1. **Security audits** — "Audited by CertiK and Trail of Bits" (link to report)
2. **TVL / Volume** — "$200M in assets secured" or "$4B in trading volume"
3. **User metrics** — "12,000 active wallets" or "50,000 daily transactions"
4. **Notable backers** — VC names, partner protocol logos
5. **Community** — Discord members, Twitter followers (weak alone, strong with above)
6. **Testimonials** — From known figures in the space with specific outcomes

**Avoid:** Vague claims like "trusted by thousands" without the number.
Metrics need context — "$4B volume" means nothing without the time period.

### 5d. Cost of Inaction / Why Now

Why act TODAY rather than later?
- Token launch timing or early access window
- Growing problem urgency (the market change from Part 1)
- Competitive disadvantage of waiting
- Quantified cost of the status quo: "Losing $X/month to bridge fees"

---

## The POV / Sales Story

Once all 5 parts are defined, the landing page should tell this narrative arc:

```
1. Context     (Part 1) "Here's what's happening in the market"
2. Problem     (Part 2) "And here's how it affects YOU specifically"
3. Status quo  (Part 3) "What you're doing today isn't working because..."
4. Solution    (Part 4) "Now you can..."
5. Outcome     (Part 5) "Which means you get..."
6. Proof       (Part 5) "Here's why you should believe us"
```

Each section of the landing page corresponds to one step of this story.
If users read top to bottom, the narrative should pull them toward conversion.

## Common Messaging Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Example | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|

| Feature dump | 20 features listed | Top 3 capabilities with benefits |
| Generic CTAs | "Connect Wallet" everywhere | Value-oriented CTAs per section |
| Jargon wall | "Stake LP tokens in our AMM protocol" | Plain language + tooltips |
| Trust gap | Audits buried in footer | Audit badge in hero |
| Nobody & everybody | "For all crypto users" | Specific ICP in headline |
| Unquantified benefits | "Low fees" "Fast transactions" | Add specific numbers |
| Feature-level product | "Multi-chain support" | Translate to capability + benefit |
