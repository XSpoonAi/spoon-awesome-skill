## Track Description

AI-Enhanced Productivity focuses on building intelligent automation that amplifies developer capabilities:

- **Smart API Orchestration**: Chain API calls with intelligent error handling
- **Cloud Automation**: Infrastructure as code, deployment pipelines
- **Data Operations**: Database queries, migrations, vector search
- **Communication**: Automated notifications, alerts, reports
- **Observability**: Metrics collection, anomaly detection, dashboards

## Why "AI-Enhanced"?

These aren't just API wrappers. The goal is to create skills that:

1. **Understand Context**: Know when to retry, escalate, or adapt
2. **Chain Operations**: Combine multiple services intelligently
3. **Handle Failures**: Graceful degradation and recovery
4. **Learn Patterns**: Optimize based on usage patterns

## Getting Started

```python
from spoon_ai.agents import SpoonReactSkill

agent = SpoonReactSkill(
    name="productivity_agent",
    skill_paths=["./ai-productivity"],
    scripts_enabled=True
)

# Example: "Send a Slack alert when the API response time exceeds 500ms"
response = await agent.run("Send a Slack alert when API response time exceeds 500ms")
```

**Or with Claude Code:**
```bash
# Copy skills to your workspace
cp -r ai-productivity/ .claude/skills/
```
