# Git Commit Semantic Submission Skill

This skill provides guidelines and standards for writing semantic git commit messages based on the Conventional Commits specification.

## Overview

Conventional Commits is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history, which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.

## Features

- **Standardized Commit Messages**: Clear rules for `feat`, `fix`, and other types.
- **Semantic Versioning Integration**: Correlates commit types with SemVer (`MAJOR`, `MINOR`, `PATCH`).
- **Automated Tooling Support**: Facilitates automated changelog generation and version bumping.

## Usage

Refer to [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) for the detailed specification and examples.
